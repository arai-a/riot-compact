Style and some JS code to make chat.mozilla.org log more compact.

 * Username, avatar, and comment in the single line
 * Same font size across timestamp/username/comment/etc
 * Smaller avatar
 * Compact rooms list
 * Compact members list
 * Alternating line coloring (done by JS)
 * Add Month/Date to the timestamp (done by JS)

WARNING

 * Enabling "Use compact timeline layout" in General Settings is necessary to make this style work properly
